Voice-Operated Application with Integrated AI Voice Differentiation

üöÄ Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a voice-operated application enhanced with AI voice differentiation capabilities. The primary objective is to facilitate voice-based interactions, enabling users to perform tasks efficiently through voice commands.

üî• Features
- Voice Recognition: Accurately interpret and process user voice commands.
- AI Voice Differentiation: Distinguish between different users based on voice characteristics.
- Task Execution: Perform specific tasks as directed by recognized voice commands.
- User Authentication: Verify user identity through voice differentiation.
- Responsive Design: Ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- AI Integration: TensorFlow.js or similar libraries for voice differentiation
- Database: MongoDB for storing user data and voice profiles
